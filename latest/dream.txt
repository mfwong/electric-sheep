a surreal scene featuring a giant, glowing jellyfish soaring through the air above a bustling cityscape, with angular, futuristic skyscrapers and neon lights reflecting off its translucent tentacles. the jellyfish seemed to be dancing or performing some sort of underwater ballet, its glowing organs pulsing in time with the beat of an invisible drummer. the scene was both mesmerizing and unsettling, as if the dream world had suddenly shifted into a psychoactive wonderland where the laws of physics no longer applied.
